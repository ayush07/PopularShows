## Quick start


- 'yarn install' or 'npm install' to install the dependencies of the application.
- 'yarn start' or 'npm start' to run the application.


## Features

- This app is developed using React Js.
- It is a responsive app which works on smaller devices as well.

## How did I decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of my solution?

<p>List of Libraries and frameworks used:</p>
- <b>SEMANTIC UI</b> framework for theming the application which offers a completely mobile responsive experience.
- <b>AXIOS</b> library for fetching the JSON data.
- <b>LODASH </b> library for sorting the JSON data in ascending alphanumeric order.
- <b>REACT-ROUTER-DOM </b> for routing.

## Are there any improvements I could make to your submission?

<p> Yes, actually I couldn't properly test the loading state of the app when JSON data is fetched.
  
## What would I do differently if I were allocated more time?

<p> I would try to break down the app into even smaller reusable components and add a bit more style.
